  # Rodentians

  <Box>

  Rodentians are a race of humanoid beings resembling rodents. Resourceful, evasive, sneaky, but fragile. They are [color=#1e90ff]able to eat raw meat.[/color]

  They slash with their claws instead of using their fists, dealing [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Blunt[/color] damage.

  Due to their [color=yellow]small stature[/color], Rodentians can also [color=#1e90ff]fit into duffel bags[/color]. However, this comes at the cost of being [color=#ec3a3a]25% easier to knock down[/color].

  ## Special

  - Can rummage in disposal chutes, sometimes digging up food.
  - Can store small items in their cheeks. However, having items in their mouth makes their speech unintelligible. If attacked, stunned, or shoved, they will drop all items in their mouth.
  - Can "sneak" underneath tables, but not doors.

  ## Drawbacks

  - Takes 30% more Blunt damage, and 15% more Slash and Piercing damage.
  - Gets hungry 33% faster.
