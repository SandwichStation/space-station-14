  # Core Rule 6
  ## ERP is discouraged, but Sexual Content is allowed.

  We are an 18+ server and permit mature content. That being said, we are not strictly an Erotic Roleplay (ERP) server.

  If you hold a position of any importance (Any command role) you should not dedicate your time to ERP and should be doing your job.

  If you are a non-essential civilian role or Assistant, you are more free to engage in ERP. However, again, ERP is not the focus of this server.

  Any ERP must be consensual both in-character (IC) and out-of-character (OOC), and not forced.

  Explicit sexual activities must be taken to a private location.

  Content and fetishes of an extreme nature are prohibited. Keep it vanilla.

  An admin may request you stop an ERP at any time.

  ## Exemptions
  - During a Greenshift this rule may be relaxed, but still at the admins discretion.

  ## Allowed
  - Making lewd and suggestive comments to other characters.
  - Light, consensual activities of a sexual nature in public.
  - Explicit, consensual activities in a private location.

  ## Prohibited
  - Any form of non-consensual (either IC or OOC) sexual activity.
  - Any form of extreme fetish content. (e.g. necrophilia, bestiality, scat, etc.)
  - Any form of ERP that is disruptive to the shift.
