  # Core Rule 5
  ## Be fun for all, not just yourself.

  SandwichStation is a roleplay game, and most of the fun comes from interacting with our community.

  Try to do things that are fun for everyone, not just yourself.

  Even as an antagonist, try to play in a way that leaves players impressed with you, and not just annoyed.

  ## Greytiding
  'Greytiding' - the act of causing mischief and disarray, typically in the Assistant role - is allowed, but should be restricted to petty crimes, to give Security something to do during quiet rounds.

  Typically, greytiding is done by the Assistant role, but non-essential civilian roles may participate.

  Essential roles - as in, any role in a department or civilian services - should not be greytiding.

  Any sort of sabotage that causes mass dysfunction across the station or department(s) is prohibited and will be considered as a self-antagonistic action, and will likely result in a ban.

  Admins have full discretion over what is and is not excessive greytiding.

  ## Good Examples
  - As a Bartender, arranging a party for the crew in the bar.
  - As a Clown, telling jokes and pulling harmless pranks.
  - As a Salvager, ensuring that the rest of the crew is supplied with the materials they need.
  - As a Nuclear Operative, giving the crew a fair and solid fight.
  - As a Traitor, being creative and calculated in completing your objectives to give Security and the Detective the run around.

  ## Bad Examples
  - As a Security Officer, hassling a player for no reason.
  - As a Salvager, stripping Cargo of all its equipment and leaving the station for the entire round without contributing back.
  - As a Clown, interfering with the crew's ability to work.
  - As anyone, sabotaging the power grid as a non-antagonist.
