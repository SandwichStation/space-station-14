  # Core Rule 8
  ## Do not attempt to evade bans.
  [bold]This is non-negotiable, zero tolerance and will result in a permanent ban.[/bold]

  This rule is very simple. Do not attempt to evade bans.

  If you are server banned, do not attempt to join the server under a different account or VPN.

  If you are role banned, do not attempt to get access to a role you are banned from. (e.g. job change via Head of Personnel)

  Violation of this rule will apply an unappealable ban with no exceptions.
