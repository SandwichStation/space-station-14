  # Core Rule 2
  ## You MUST only use English.
  [color=#ff0000][bold]This is non-negotiable.[/bold][/color]

  This server is in English only.

  You must be able to speak English fluently enough for others to understand you.

  If you are unable to speak English sufficiently enough, we will ask you to leave.

  If you refuse to leave, you will be banned.

  ## Exemptions
  - You are allowed to use other languages in your character's name, but they must be writen in Latin characters (e.g. "„ÅÇ" is not allowed, "a" is allowed).
  - Accent traits, certain items and effects will often substitute English words with words from other languages, this is part of the game and is allowed.
  - Occasionally using a word from another language as part of a character quirk is allowed, but you must still be understandable. Explain in-character what the word means.
