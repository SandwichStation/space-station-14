  ## Admins have the final say.

  The rules are not perfect, but they attempt to clearly communicate what the admin team intends to be allowed and prohibited. There are likely to be loopholes or other flaws that can be "lawyered" out of.

  Do not attempt to manipulate the interpretation of the rules to suit your personal goals or to degrade the experience of other players. If you are unsure of something, follow the more restrictive option until you are able to ask an admin and get clarification.

  Admins can still override rules if they deem it in the best interests of the current round, server, and/or community at large.

  Online admins are able to make the final interpretations of the rules during a round.

  Even if you disagree with how an admin interprets a rule, you must follow the interpretation they provide for you.

  If admins believe that you are an overall negative impact to the community or rounds, you will be banned.

  You are permitted to contest an admin action or interpretation of rules through contacting Yuuchan directly, an investigation will be carried out.

  All accountability for actions made by admins is held by the server owner, Yuuchan. If you have a complaint about an admin, you can contact Yuuchan through our Discord server. Do not hassle the admin in question.
