  # JOB EXPECTATIONS
  ## Assistant

  The Assistant is a waste of space; they have no responsibilities and no job expectations, as they have no job. Everyone, including the Clown, has authority over an Assistant, and they should do as they're told. Ideally, an Assistant should seek to get employment in a department via the HoP.

  Assistants are prejudicially assumed to be 'Greytiders', due to their absolute disregard for NT policies. Be a better Assistant and prove everyone wrong.

  ## Do
  - Do as you're told, within the limits of the law (and rules).
  - Consider getting a job, lazy ass.

  ## Don't
  - Overstep the bounds of acceptable Greytiding. Sabotage, destruction and violence are self-antagonistic behaviours and will result in a server ban.
  - Validhunt. If you want a chance to be the hero, you should join Security.
  - Lose your insuls.
