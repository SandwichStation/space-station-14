  # JOB EXPECTATIONS
  ## Cargo Technician

  The Cargo Technician is responsible for handling import and export from the station to the ATS. They can achieve this by using the cargo shuttle and the cargo console.

  ## Do
  - Haul goods to and from the ATS.
  - Complete bounties for fat profits.
  - Fulfil order requests from the crew, so long as they're reasonable.
  - Hold in the innate desire to declare independence as the great nation of Cargonia.

  ## Don't
  - Do Salvage work. You're a Cargo Technician, not a Salvage Specialist. Get approval from the QM or above first.
  - Approve orders for weapons without approval from the QM or above.
  - Break into departments to get items for a cargo bounty. Ask the department staff. (The maints are free game, though!)
