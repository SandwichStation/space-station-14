  # JOB EXPECTATIONS
  ## Salvage Specialist

  The Salvage Specialist is responsible for salvaging items and mining raw ores. They're given a dedicated mining shuttle and a plethora of tools to do so. They can also risk their lives on Expeditions for rare loot.

  Salvagers should work closely with Science to get new tools unlocked for themselves in return for providing Science with the materials they need.

  Protip: The mining shuttle is in need of repairs. Try salvaging other wrecked shuttles for more engines.

  ## Do
  - Go mining for the station.
  - Seriously, go mining. The station needs materials.
  - Explore the Mining Asteroid for loot.
  - Return back to the station to deliver materials and loot.
  - (Optional) Go on Expeditions for rare loot.

  ## Don't
  - Take *ANY* lathes, vending machines or other large goods equipment from Cargo to install on the Mining Shuttle. Instead, take the equipment from the vending machines and ask Science to provide you with the machine boards to build your own lathes and ore processors. This is now zero tolerance. You will be rolebanned and server banned for repeat offences.
  - Spend all shift away from the station. You are supposed to be returning materials back. A light exception to this is if your Shuttle is linked to the station's Silo, where materials can be returned remotely. Ask a Command staff (QM should have access) to get your shuttle's lathe(s) linked to the Silo.
  - Validhunt. If you want a chance to be the hero, you should join Security.
  - Die in space. That shuttle is expensive.
