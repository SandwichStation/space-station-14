  # JOB EXPECTATIONS
  ## Bartender

  The Bartender is responsible for serving drinks to the crew. They can achieve this by using the bar and the drinks dispenser. The bar is the Bartender's domain, and although not above the law or Command, they do have more liberties in the way they handle the crew and defend the bar.

  ## Do
  - Serve refreshment to the crew.
  - Experiment with new beverages. Try making something rare!
  - Defend the bar with your double-barrelled shotgun.
  - Exercise your right to eject unruly crewmembers from the bar.

  ## Don't
  - Use the role as an excuse to be a shitter.
  - Break the law. You may be given a weapon, but its use is limited to defending the bar, unless there's a station-wide threat.
