  Most Science departments are also equipped with Circuit Imprinters and Protolathes, which can produce equipment and parts for themselves and other departments. Science should oblige other departments' requests for these things, but do reserve the right to refuse.

  ## Do
  - Conduct research to generate Research Points.
  - Use Research Points to unlock new technologies.
  - Experiment with xenobiological artifacts.
  - Locate and contain anomalies.
  - Provide equipment and parts to other Departments as needed.

  ## Don't
  - Ignore anomalies and let them cause station-wide damage.
