  ## Do
  - Know Space Law, better than the Warden if you can.
  - Represent the crew when they need legal advice.
  - Try to get your client off the hook!

  ## Don't
  - Act like an Admin; (mis)interpretation of Space Law is part of the fun. If you think a Warden/Security is objectively wrong with their ruling (such as ordering an execution), use ahelp.
