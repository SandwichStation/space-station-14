  # JOB EXPECTATIONS
  ## Off Duty

  The Off Duty crewmember is here to relax and enjoy the station without the needs to work, unlike the Passenger the Off Duty crewmember has proven to handle themselves in an emergency situation.

  Because of that, Off Duty crewmembers are granted maintenance access and are free to roam around.

  ## Do
  - Stay within the limits of the law (and rules).
  - Help out the station in case of an emergency.
  - Start a new carreer in the maintenance bar.

  ## Don't
  - Overstep the bounds of acceptable Greytiding. Sabotage, destruction and violence are self-antagonistic behaviours and will result in a server ban.
  - Validhunt. If you want a chance to be the hero, you should join Security.
  - Make the crew drunk on magaritas, they are still working, unlike you.
