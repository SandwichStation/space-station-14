  # JOB EXPECTATIONS
  ## Chaplain
  [italic]This job is primarily for roleplay and not considered as important as other roles.[/italic]

  The Chaplain is responsible for providing spiritual guidance to the crew. They can achieve this by providing religious services, counselling and helping the crew with their mental health. The Chaplain may also be requested to advise on potential supernatural threats of a religious nature.

  Additionally, the Chaplain carries a holy book which can be used to heal the crew in a pinch. Their PDA is also equipped with a health scanner, like the Medical staff. Spiritual healing comes with bodily healing. When that fails, they're usually responsible for cremating bodies of those who could not be saved.

  ## Do
  - Maintain your house of worship.
  - Provide religious services to the crew.
  - Use your holy book to heal the crew.
  - Dispose of the dearly departed in the crematorium.
  - Use the Spectral Locator to hunt spooky ghosts.
