  # JOB EXPECTATIONS
  ## Captain

  The Captain is the head of the station. They are expected to oversee the station, and ensure that the station is running smoothly. A well run station means the Captain shouldn't have to do much, but a good Captain should be prepared to fulfil any role that is needed. The most important thing is to secure the Nuclear Disk, however.

  ## Do
  - Secure the Nuclear Disk at ALL times.
  - Ensure the station is running smoothly.
  - Have knowledge of every department on the station in the event that a department is in need of assistance.
  - Protect Hamlet.

  ## Don't
  - Abuse your authority.
  - Interfere in departments when it's not needed.
  - Give out All Access (AA) to just anyone.
