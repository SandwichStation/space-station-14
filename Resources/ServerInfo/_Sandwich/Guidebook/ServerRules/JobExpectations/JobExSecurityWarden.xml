  - Apply fair and correct sentences to prisoners.
  - Ensure the armory is kept secure, and be ready to permit access when the situation requires it.
  - Make yourself aware of Space Law.
  - Lead by example.

  ## Don't
  - Participate in arrests, leave that to the Security Officers.
  - Give armory access to anyone who asks, only do so when the situation requires it or Command has ordered it.
