  # Roleplay Rule 1
  ## Crew must follow their Job Expectations.

  All crew are expected to perform their duties in line with their Job Expectations. Of course, circumstances may arise where a crew member is unable to perform their duties, but during normal station operation, crew members are expected to perform their duties to the best of their ability.
