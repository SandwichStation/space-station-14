  # Roleplay Rule 5
  ## Do not act like an antagonist, unless the game tells you that you are one.

  Acting like an antagonist when you are not one is often referred to as "self-antagging" or being a "self-antag", both of these things are against the rules. You are not an antagonist unless the game tells you that you are an antagonist. Do not make yourself a major problem, annoyance, or disruption while not an antagonist. Do not willfully cooperate with known antagonists. Non-antagonists should typically either not have an overall effect on the round, or should have an overall positive effect on the round.

  ## Examples
  These examples assume that you are not an antagonist.

  Acceptable:
  - Stealing or breaking a glass from the bar.
  - Replacing someone's shoes with clown shoes.
  - Giving everyone all access during war ops. (This is not necessarily a good idea)

  Prohibited:
  - Starting a cult.
  - Starting a revolution.
  - Mutinying the captain because they would not let you become the chief medical officer.
  - Randomly smashing lots of station lights.
  - Disrupting station power.
  - Spacing parts of the station.
  - Distributing significant levels of access without a good reason.
  - Stealing high risk or high value items, like the nuclear authentication disk, for no reason.

  ## Admeme Exemptions
  If approved by the admins (Central Command) then any of the above prohibited actions may be allowed. It is important to note that you should never ask an admin to approve your self-antag; an admin will approach you with approval, usually for the purposes of a roleplay event or admeme.
