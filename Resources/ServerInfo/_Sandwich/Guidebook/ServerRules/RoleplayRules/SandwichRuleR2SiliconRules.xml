  # Roleplay Rule 2
  ## Silicons must follow Silicon Rules.

  You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon. For players who are silicons, the Silicon Rules override all Roleplay Rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override Core Rules.

  You can find more information about the Silicon Rules below:
