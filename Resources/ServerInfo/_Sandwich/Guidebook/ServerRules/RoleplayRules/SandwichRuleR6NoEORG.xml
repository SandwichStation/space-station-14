  # Roleplay Rule 6
  ## Do not End-of-Round Grief (EORG).

  End-of-Round Grief (EORG) is defined as any form of griefing that occurs after the round has ended. This includes but is not limited to:
  - Killing any character(s) after the round has ended, unless justifiable. (e.g. a captured antagonist has been approved for execution by CC/Admins, CBURN, Death Squad, etc.)
  - Disrupting any play between characters that is still ongoing of which you had no part in, unless your contribution is justifiable.
  - Causing any level of mass sabotage to CentComm or the Evac shuttle after the round has ended.

  'End-of-Round' is defined as the moment between when the results window appears and the lobby screen appears.

  Players are expected to remain in character until the lobby screen appears.

  Deathmatch, Sandbox and players in the Murderbox are exempt from this and all other Roleplay Rules.
