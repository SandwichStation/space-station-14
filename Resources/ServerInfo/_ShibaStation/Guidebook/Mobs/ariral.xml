  The Arirals (ah-ree-ral) are a race of cat-like alien humanoids. Towering over humans, they can at first seem rather intimidating - but the real danger is their natural toxicity; even simple contact with them can be dangerous.

  ## Diet

  - Shares the same diet as humans.
  - Raw animal proteins will make them sick.

  ## Benefits

  - They take 20% less Blunt damage.
  - They take 90% less Poison damage, on account of their natural toxins.
  - Their unarmed melee strikes transfer some of their natural toxins to their target. With sufficient exposure, the target will vomit, hallucinate and be poisoned!
  - Their blood is even more toxic, which could have some uses...

  ## Drawbacks

  - They take 15% more Slash and Pierce damage.
  - They take 20% more Cold and Radiation damage.
  - They bleed more easily; losing blood faster, clotting and regenerating blood slower.
  - They tire faster than humans, having less overall stamina.
  - They can't be hugged or pet, no matter how much you want to.
